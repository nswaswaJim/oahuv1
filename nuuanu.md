## Nuuanu

The route:  Urban biking through town.  Then uphill biking on Pali Highway.  Turn off at Toho No then winding road up to Ginger pond.  Ah, finally, hike!

"Build a mile of road, you can go one mile.  Build a mile of runway, you can go anywhere."<br>
On the way up you start getting some vistas through the trees, like this one back towards HNL:

Alone in the tall lush forest full of calming peaceful sounds, hard to believe just a few miles back was urban biking:

The trail starts to change after gaining some elevation- drier, more level, more sunshine:

The forest has changed higher up, with cool breeze now more prominent than the birds lower down the trail:

I wasn't expecting a boardwalk!!!  The Nuuanu trail joins the Pauoa Flats trail, where a few boardwalks keep you above most of the mud.
