## Nuuanu

The route:  Urban biking through town.  Then uphill biking on Pali Highway.  Turn off at Toho No then winding road up to Ginger pond.  Ah, finally, hike!

The trail starts with an easy crossing of Nuuanu stream.  At this level you can rock-hop and keep your shoes on and feet dry.

"Build a mile of road, you can go one mile.  Build a mile of runway, you can go anywhere."<br>
On the way up you start getting some vistas through the trees, like this one back towards HNL:

Alone in the tall lush forest full of calming peaceful sounds, hard to believe just a few miles back was urban biking:

The trail starts to change after gaining some elevation- drier, more level, more sunshine:

The forest has changed higher up, with cool breeze now more prominent than the birds lower down the trail:

I wasn't expecting a boardwalk!!!  The Nuuanu trail joins the Pauoa Flats trail, where a few boardwalks keep you above most of the mud.

Christine.  She has been bombproof reliable in her mission of taking us to trailheads.  Good job girl!

...5 minutes after taking the above pic, we were rolling down the road back towards Pali Highway.  Going fast.  Alternating between front and rear brakes trying just to keep our speed within manageable limits, while thinking in wonder that just a few hours before we were in a slow, steady, laborious uphill low gear hill climbing grind, working for every foot of elevation gain, pedal by pedal.  Now, enjoying that investment in potential energy at high speed...

WHAM!  We hit a small pothole at high speed, a whole-body jarring kind of hit.  Still rolling at high speed I ask "wow, sorry Christine, you ok?!?" That we were still in control indicated maybe she was. The hissing sound from the front tire indicated perhaps she was not.  

Lucky Pali Highway was very near.  Thanks to the cool people at TheBus, who gave Christine and I a ride down to town and to my now favorite bike shop Velohana on Nuuanu.  Where I met owner Will and Triathlete Ku, who stopped what they were doing to hooked me up with a new tube install and got me back on my way in no time.  So I missed biking back down Pali Highway, but met two awesome people instead and now have a new fav bikeshop.
