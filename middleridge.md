## Middle ~~fork~~ ridge!-

### Second attempt success :-)

Prior attempt on Saturday was turned back due rain.  The rain was moderate and steady.  That's not enough to make one give up.  But the trail conditions- this is a steep trail- were going from terrible to really terrible.  Water was starting to run down the already slippery trail, with about 3000 steps to go- and then back down again- I turned around to come back another day.

Today is Tuesday, July 4th- a holiday!  And 3 days later.  And the forecast was for clear.  Try again.  So glad on both decisions!  


Route map:  Green for bus.  I rode this just 3 days ago,  So to save a little time and hit the trail fresh today I only biked a little, to where the bus could pick me up.

After several minutes and wandering the first bit of the olympus trail decided against it.
