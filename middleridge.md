## Middle ~~fork~~ ridge!-

### Second attempt success :-)

Flashback to prior attempt on Saturday:  About a quarter way in I was turned back due rain.  The rain was moderate and steady.  That's not enough to make one give up.  But the trail conditions- this is a steep trail- were going from terrible to really terrible.  Water was starting to run down the already slippery trail, with about 3000 steps to go, every one of them a slip hazard.  And then back down again.   I turned around to come back another day.

Now, 3 days later- 4th of July!  A day off.   And the forecast was for clear.  Try again.  Today, so glad of the prior decision to turn back, so glad I came back here to finish what was started!


Route map:  The trail begins at the common trailhead for Mt. Olympus (climbed a few weeks ago) and the much shorter Pu'u Pia overlook trail (hiked Saturday as my fallback plan b in the rain.)   Zoom in map for trailhead visual.   Blue icon is end of Manoa Middle Ridge Rail.  Green mountain icon to the southeast is Olympus, to the north is K2:

Before the Pu'u Pia summit the middle ridge trail branches down very steeply to the right into a dense jungle valley, steeply and mud-slippery loosing about 200 feet in the process.   The Waiakeakua stream runs through the bottom of the valley.  Video shows the lushness of this place:

There are trails running up and down both sides of the stream and it is not at all well marked which way to go.  But the sun was at my 1 o'clock, stream was to my right, ahead is up- this will probably work.  An occasional bit of survey tape, and a bootprint of someone who hopefully had a map, were encouraging.   Otherwise, this bamboo forest could be leading anywhere:

Before too long you get out of the bamboo and clearly onto the proper ridge trail.  The trail is difficult.  Muddy, very slippery, very narrow with ferns and brush encroaching on the edges and brushing your legs with every step. Rocks and roots and narrow and more slippery.  Not pleasant hiking.   Just determined hiking.  The rain which turned me back days ago, and the mud it left behind, will not stop me from getting to the top of this ridge.

One small advantage this morning- I had biked/hiked part of this just two days before.  So today, to save a little time and effort, I had taken the bus to the trailhead.  Instead of grinding up hills in low gear.   Thus I had hit the trailhead pretty fresh and rested.  So I had to laugh out loud when, thinking I was just reaching a false summit with more of this trail- instead, the windward side came into view- I had reached the ridge!  Ahead of schedule, despite the gruesome trail conditions.  

The weather was quite low on reaching the ridge, with clouds blowing up from the windward side.  It reminded me of telling flight students to carefully open the window and stick their hand out to touch a cloud:

Looking Southeast along the fantastic Ko'olau ridge, towards Mt. Olympus.  Been there not long ago.  Ah, that was a good hike!  And with a good trail.

Possibilities of hiking over to Olympus and going back down that way ran through my head.
