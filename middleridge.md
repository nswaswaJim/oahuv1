## Middle ~~fork~~ ridge!-

### Second attempt success :-)

Flashback to prior attempt on Saturday:  I was turned back due rain.  The rain was moderate and steady.  That's not enough to make one give up.  But the trail conditions- this is a steep trail- were going from terrible to really terrible.  Water was starting to run down the already slippery trail, with about 3000 steps to go- and then back down again- I turned around to come back another day.

Now, 3 days later- 4th of July!  A day off.   And the forecast was for clear.  Try again.  Today, so glad of the prior decision to turn back, so glad I came back here to finish what was started!


Route map:  Green for bus.  I rode this just 3 days ago,  So to save a little time and hit the trail fresh today I only biked a little, to where the bus could pick me up.  As always, thanks Alltrails for Google maps KML data:

The trail begins at the common trailhead for Mt. Olympus (climbed a few weeks ago) and the much shorter Pu'u Pia overlook trail (hiked Saturday as a plan b in the rain.)  Before the Pu'u Pia summit the middle ridge trail branches down very steeply to the right into a dense jungle valley, steeply and mud-slippery loosing about 200 feet in the process.   The Waiakeakua stream runs through the bottom of the valley.  Video shows the lushness of this place:

There are trails on each side of the stream and it is not at all well marked which way to go.  But the sun was at my 1 o'clock, stream was to my right, ahead is up- this will probably work.  An occasional bit of survey tape, and a bootprint of someone who hopefully had a map, were encouraging.   Otherwise, this bamboo forest could be leading anywhere:

Before too long you get out of the bamboo and onto the proper ridge trail.  The trail is difficult- muddy, very slippery, very narrow with ferns and brush encroaching on the edges and brushing your legs with every step.  Not exactly pleasant hiking!  



...hike details, then bam, touching clouds...

After several minutes and wandering the first bit of the olympus trail decided against it.
