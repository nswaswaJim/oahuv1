### Beach Camping, biking, and hiking!

A packed weekend, fortuitously brought about by our annual conference on Friday on the Windward side in Haleiwa!  And while on that beautiful side of the island, why not explore a bit?  

Maleakahana Beach on the northeast corner has a campground.  I did not have a reservation because I threw this plan together kinda last minute, but long story short- security man at Maleakahana Camp hooked me up with a tiny, secret overflow campsite at 7pm Friday night.   Soon I'm sitting on the beach, under the stars and a waxing half moon, in front of a campfire, eating takeaway Brazilian food from the nearby food trucks in Kahuka.  With the sound of surf on the beach, wind in the trees, and crackling campfire.  

The night was great, as was sunrise:

The next logical step was to visit Maleakahana falls after camping at Maleakahana beach.  

Blue for bike, red for hike.  Thanks to Alltrails for the KML map data.  Which I did not have with me...

Maleakahana falls trail, along with it's big sister trail Laie falls trail, are both on private property and thus require permits from Hawaii Reserves, Inc.  Permit is available via email, very kind woman in the office processed mine Thursday afternoon.  

Laie falls trailhead is pretty clearly marked both on a map from Hawaii Reserves and on Google Maps.  Maleakahana Falls trailhead- not so much.  From the little bit I had read about, it was just a short distance after the Laie trailhead- can't be too tough to find, right?  

So I enjoyed a pleasant morning ride from Maleakahana beach to the north side of Laie, then up through the small farms in the hills, past the well marked Laie falls trail.  Past the point of network and Google maps, running on my internal memory now... 

After one false start I did find what could have been the trailhead hidden in the turns of country road meandering through the patches of small farms interspersed in the forest.  Let's bike up and find a hillside.  Let's bike up this a bit and maybe get a hilltop with a view and hopefully network.

Bike was heavy and road was deteriorating from country road to muddy steep two track to the point where biking was unfeasable.  Time to park and walk.  Still not exactly sure I was on the right trail.  I reassured myself that I was mostly heading west by southwest, gaining altitude, the major drainage was on my right, the distance seemed to agree with what I had seen on the map.  Still, dead reckoning and most basic pilotage is not the best means of navigation for a hike!  Pressed on anyway.

With altitude and distance the trail changed dramatically, from a jungle forest walk to occaisional exposed sunny stretches.  Which did offer great views of the northern end of the windward side.  For location reference, note the windmills in the distance on the left. Still not exactly sure if I'm on the correct trail.  However going for random lost walk in the remote hills isn't a bad way to spend the morning. </p> 

Panoramic video from a break in the trees:

Soon the trail changed again, into what felt like tunneling though this thick growth.  Less panoramic views but welcome shade, and absolutely no doubt that you are on a trail to somewhere.

But trail to where?  I still wasn't sure this was the intended trail.  Not long after the above pic the trail deteriorated tremendously.  The thicket grew thicker and the canopy overhead denser as the trail turned down a north-facing slope of perpetual shade due to the forest above.  The trail became a steep, narrow, confused stew of roots and rocks, all covered in a super slick carpet of leaves and mud.  Thoughts of turning back crossed my mind.  Again, I was not sure this was even the trail I wanted to be on.  So I had two competing voices in my head.  A bit of a life parallel there- the crew better have belief in the plan.  The crew must trust that the leader knows the course.  Any doubts will erode the crew's morale, and that will impact the mission and it's chance of success.  Even if the crew is just one potentially lost guy wandering an unknown trail and having an argument with himself. 

But the trail was sloping downward and turning north after heading southwest for a few miles.  That was on the map I had looked at a few days prior. There was also the faintest sound of running water- hard to pick out from the wind in the trees.  All of this was enough to push on, down the dark and gloomy forest of Gollum.  No place for pics because hands were busy gabbing onto the trees for handholds.  So even the otherwise impenetrable mess of scrawny trees in the dark undergrowth serve a purpose.  

After crossing a small stream, at last, come across:  The falls!

So there's a few more picturesque falls on the island.  That don't take wandering about looking for an unmarked, un Google-mapped trailhead; that don't require a few miles hike before a trek descent through Gollum's forest.  

But then those other very nice to look at falls don't give the same sense of achievement.  These falls took a bike and a hike and a chunk of a day.  That I could have spent doing...whatever it is that normal people do.  

Back up the dark forest with a quick pace to beat the coming rain and a happy heart that I had reached the goal and was now definitely hiking to where I had left my bike.  And if she's not there, no big deal, just keep walking until I reach TheBus.  She would likely be there though- due to remoteness and other issues mentioned above, I did not see a single person since leaving the farms, either on the way in or out.  On a Saturday.  So if you want lots of big-money-shot quality photos, don't come here.  If you want to get off the beaten path, this place is pretty good :-)
