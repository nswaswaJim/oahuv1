## Kaala, highest peak on Oahu


Kaala!!! Revisited, reloaded, even better.

Kaala gets two entries- not because she's the tallest, but because I couldn't stay away and went back up again.

Kaala1 link is the first climb.  Added a few pics after the second climb, (6/3). 

Kaala2 obviously is the second, more improved bike 'n hike.
