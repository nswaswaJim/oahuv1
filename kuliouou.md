## Kuliouou

### A fantastic bike 'n hike!!!

### {{}}

Got lucky with an outstanding trip today!  Semi-randomly picked a spot on Google Maps and ended up shocking myself with how great a bike and hike it turned out to be!  

Ok, the bike portion:  About 8ish miles, about double my daily trip to work. With a small difference- hills!  There's no way to get around Diamond head without climbing, (uphill both ways!) and for the Kuliouou trail there is a literally breathtaking steep climb before the trailhead.  But not for too long, just enough to make sure my heart was beating before even starting the hike.   Then things got good. (Hike portion below map) 

The route:

Blue for bike out, red for hike, purple-ish for return route on the Southwest side of Diamond head.

 The hike:  Starts off uneventfully, just like expected from the write-ups and the map:  Switchbacks on a shaded, forested trail.  The trail is very good, the gradient is perfect to gain altitude at a reasonable rate, and after a few switchbacks the forest changes to mostly pine.  

The sound of the birds, the whisper of the wind in the trees, the soft steady sound of my bootsteps on the soft trail, cushioned and muffled by a carpet of pine needles. Not bad at all! Occasional views of the coast started poking through the trees, but the real views yet to come.  More hiking/climbing to be done.

Initial switchbacks on easy hiking trail:

With more altitude you reach the ridge, where the predominent sound is wonderful wind:

When you reach the Stairmaster you're almost there!  Views start getting awesome around here.

Morning sun reflecting off the water and giving the ridgeline beautiful light and shadows:

On the way down, just below the peak, is time for the views of the coast looking west.

No trip complete without a pic of Christine, who flawlessly got us to Kuliouou trailhead.  Up, around, and down both sides of Diamond head, and back home.  Then to a coffee shop to relax and upload pics.  And sitting next to me now as I write this up in the shade with a cool breeze on the edge of the water.  What a great day!
