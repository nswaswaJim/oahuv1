### 9 June  

Things happening kinda fast, but good.  A good Friday for sure.  From my notes on Tues 6 June:  

> Wow, maybe found it?  1981 Union Polaris 36â€™ sailboat.  Contacted Josh, meet Fri...    

Today is Friday.  Met Josh after work, very cool guy, gave me tour of Union Polaris 36-  
"Moondrop".

Stunning, breathtaking, absolute beautiful.  Not perfect- needs paint on many places, some spots kind of desperately, others not emergency but soon for preservation.   Most of outside needs cosmetic.  Josh is slowly working on bits by the cockpit, though those admittedly are in best shape to begin with.

Woodwork inside looks great.   Dings, scratches, normal wear and tear, normal for an older boat that is being lived in.  But far, far more important- solid.  Absolutely solid.  Every piece of wood felt heavy, immobile.  Hull to deck joins, bulkheads, floor, every single thing felt as solid as if it were still the original tree it was cut from.  Two of us getting on the boat and moving around were nearly imperceptible.  Understandale, the two of us getting on board, est. 340 pounds total, should have immersed Moondrop about a quarter of an inch.  

Outside, deck felt solid.  Walked over most of it, absolutely solid.  Josh pointed out a few spots he intended to work on.  I rather hope he does not but instead works on the slip, but more on that in a minute.  

I hope not to jinx anything, but this really is a perfect boat.  Stunningly perfect, like didn't know a boat could be so perfect.  Her imperfections are perfect- the peeling paint on the gunwale, the teak handrail that has been abused by the sun and is in desperate need of some love.  These things just take time and attention.  They are not huge money sinks, nor would throwing money at them make them better.  Just the love and time and dedication.  Josh has all of that but has been busy with other things and is moving on.  Time for Jim to pick up where he's leaving off and put all of my heart and time into it.  Moondrop will love me back by just becoming more beautiful.  

Other details?  Mast is aluminum.  Handrails, deck hardware, fittings, rails, deck itself- all feel as solid as the rest of the boat.  Charlie I think his name is, the barnacle cleaner.  We came across him on the dock, he commented the hull is good.  A look in the bilge by the engine- clean, dry, solid.  Engine?

Well that's a little disappointing.  Josh explained that the previous owner's strategy for the initial electric engine was- car batts.  Yes, my ghetto emergency plan was same as his initial install plan?!?  Banange.  No matter, though the install may have been a wonky project to start with, it's the path Moondrop is on now and I shall continue with it.  Motor, charging, batt boxes, etc should all still be good, Josh said it did used to work and no known failures except a bunch of dead batts.  So 9.9hp outboard for now, Josh says gets almost 4kts on it.  So even motoring can be in Keehi in 2ish hours and a few gallons gas.  I will then slowly work out getting batt/electric motor system running again.

And that is where she's likely going?  I called Keehi Thursday, was told very nicely by Gina that nothing available.  No problem, Keehi is plan B, right?  Isaac at Ala Wai had said 'as long as a boat is not here on a temp already, I can get a 120 day temp when I buy her.'  Well Josh said she IS at ala wai on a temp, runs out in July.  And Josh is leaving island in August-ish, wants boat sorted by then.  I suggested this might be advantagous for both- he has time and knowledge and contacts to look for spot.  I was just cold caller asking Keehi for a slot, whereas he knows- harbors have to keep some slots available for itenerents who just rock up. So his plan is, Tues, go check Keehi and get settled there.  Then he has a little time to unpack boat slowly before leaving island for a few months, and me- I'm not in a hurry, I just don't want this boat to slip away- can wait until July/Aug- what IS important for me however is have boat situated somewhere with a little time to sort thigs out.  Josh and I discussed further options beyond Keehi- Waianae, wouldn't be bad, or Haleiwa.  Well I would suck it up and accept that if only way to get this boat.  Actually looking now at thebus routes and I COULD do Haleiwa- Cannery as easy as Waianae.  Or could do from Kaneohe for that matter.  So thanks to theBus it looks like any harbor on the island could technically work, even on athe daily basis if needed.  Though keep fingers crossed and positive thoughs for Josh's smiling happy self on Tuesday to get good results in Keehi Tuesday.  Then we  move Moondrop, do the transfer paperwork etc and bam, I own a boat in Keehi!!! (or plan b elsewhere).  Thenk have 120ish days to look for next harboar, but WILL find one.  Josh's logic was reassuring, that there is always a way , that you won't have to sell a boat to someone else (just for them to take the same 120 days in your spot) just cuz your paperwork ran out.  He's right.  This boat will work, Josh wants me to hae her, he likes my flex attitude towards time.  

More good news which Josh might be right about- he said the 3 night per week rule, which limits people without live-aboard status to 3n/week, does not apply to 120 day temps?  Seems hard to believe, though in some ways makes sense- 120 temp is much harder to track number of nights; is a temp plan intended for itinerents, etc.  So maybe possible.  Even if not- 3 days a week, and bus in from Haleiwa, waianae, Kaneohe, etc would get more work done than not having my Moondrop.  Cannot let her slip away.  Liveaboard complete with 120 permit well that would also be cool, to not have to count days, to not need to spend 4 nights away?  See what the week brings.  

And lifestyle?  Even 3/wk, would work fine.  Sleep some on boat, some in promenade.  Or wai.  or 321.  Flexible.  Cannery isn't forever, Moondrop is.  

Some closing good thoughts:  Josh said he's happy to go for a spin for a shakedown.  Said he's got tons of extra stuff- misc tools, sandpaper,etc, will stay on boat.  I agreed, he doesn't need to move sandpaper, and I could surely use it, makes sense just leave on boat.

Josh said one other guy seemed serious, sounded like military guy, he might be able to take right away to rainbow.  But he wants to come back and look at it, pull panels, etc.  Good thing- I offered Josh asking price, said i love it and don't need to pull any other panel.  this guy wants to pull panels, maybe haggle, maybe wants boat at rainbow right now yet Josh isn't ready to move out just yet?  So some things in my favor.  Fate, destiny, is in my favor.  

Distant plan B is 74 fuji john alden ketch.  Looks much nicer than moondrop in pics anyway.  Sound like also might be military, so that might lure Josh's other guy away.  I hope.  He takes the fancy boat, I take the strong heavy boat.  Good deal for all involved.  Ketch's respons of 'i can't show it for a couple weeks' indicates military, 'slip maybe tranfer' indicates military (or maybe la mariana?), if military and taking time, will lure Josh' military guy that way.  Meanwhile Josh will take my offer cuz his time is also running.  Good for all.  

So, insha Allah, I might have made a verbal MOU to buy Moondrop.  Best case- she's mine, she's at keehi shortly, Josh and I transfer things smoothly, and soon I'm the one living on Moondrop at least part time.  Cleaning, servicing, with all my heart and love.  Still bike'n'hike, still work, still clean, nothing else change.  Except my heart will be overflowing.  


### 11 June

Sunday:  A great, great bike 'n hike day!!!  And, bonus, long weekend, off tomorrow!!!  Will enjoy a bit of rest, pushed bikenhike kinda hard today. Sleep good tonight...

Thoughts all day about Moondrop.  Josh texted me in afternoon, like:  Keehi closed Tues, will go in Weds to check.  

No problem, this is good, he's still working hard to get to Keehi, the other guy is probably still interested in pulling panels and haggling, where Josh is interested in where to keep boat and he knows I'm ready.  I told him wherever she parks, I'll take her.  Just need more time than what the little remaining on Alawai is.  Convenient as Ala wai would have been, Keehi be even better, moooring ball even best yet, come on Josh work your magic!  Moondrop, aka the Teak Tank, is very likely going to be mine soon.  

Things I can do while waiting: 
- finish boater safety course.  
- make nice printable pdfs for DOBOR.  
- plan day to get ppwrk to sand island.  Weds pm?  Work half day?  Research:  Wait list per harbor or island wide?  ie submit once or at each desired?  Find out Tuesday.    
- still follow up ronell.  Won't need that option but per murphy, if i keep the option I won't need it.  

- look into transport- that inflatable kayak looked best if moored.  If not bike is perfect keehi.  If Wai, I already know the drill.  If Hale, need research but will be similar to wai.  Can't do anything until I know location but at least have plan at the ready.  
- start organize specific plan and prioritize:
- security
    - padlock?  Combo?
    - md?  Don't piss off neighbors.
    - other ways?  Josh will have good grip on this btw.  
- rough clean
- organize for night stay
- elec/water

Then:
- deck cover worst spots
- start treating worst spots
- keep on where Josh started on outside, inside can wait
- clean part 2
- make more habitable for stay
- clean part 3

- order cruel sea for Josh

- other stuff- alltrails, keep up blog, keep fresh with Vic, keep up bike'nhike, sanity mostly.  Eyes open, keep life SA.
