# week 24

## Sun 18:

Met with Josh Sat am.  Moondrop, awesome dream, Josh gave me a little deeper tour, showed me some details of what needs attention inside (noting is like 911 at this point, though does need attention.)  He had removed 16 batts, wow like submarine!  They were from like 2013ish, some bulging, no point trying to save.  He gave me tour of rigging, all seems much more straightforward after very brief hoisting, furling.  I can do all this.  
He gave good update- going back Mon to Keehi to confirm ball, and is hoping Weds to move.  His progress is remarkable, he will most likely achieve Weds.  I told him I now have kayak, can put on board for Weds?  Likely but will confirm.  No matter.  Also told him I can take off Weds, or any other day needed, for paperwork at Keehi.  But weds probably busy with move, likely won't be keehi office day on Weds.  
He dropped bombshell:  Said to be fair and honest another guy is seriously looking (I suspect panel puller dude?), and though Josh does like him, Josh also thinks he's not realistic about reality of being on a mooring ball.  Josh also said the other guy has shown proof of funds, I have not; further said that when Josh told other guy about me he said 'bidding war!' as if he really wants MD and has the cash to back it.  I said nothing about bidding war, don't wanna get into one, and really can't afford it.  Hopefully my quiet email of screenshot of avail funds and affirmation that I can handle ball will be enough.  Summary, Josh did sound like I was his plan B at that moment.  Nothing I could do except keep being cool and send that simple mail.  One thing might be in my favor is if bidding war panel puller idiot realizes I'm not into a bidding war, he may then start trying to talk Josh down, (maybe again, as he likely already did if he's kind of guy quick to start a bidding war to get the boat, likely to haggle to get better price if he thinks he can.)  So maybe he will haggle again due to his haggling and inability to handle mooring reality; and Josh will have better reality that this was meant for me.  Nothing to do but wish for best until Mon.  Other thing in my favor- Josh did take time to meet with me, Saturday viewing was his idea, and at a time when he's obviously very busy.  Maybe he just wanted chance in person to get confirmation on the cash issue?  Maybe seeing what my reaction would be- would I offer more, could he be doing typical 'I got another buyer...' to see what I'll pay?  Don't know, and nothing I can do about any of that but wait, come on Yoda and The Force, I'm really needing this.  Don't forget there are plan b, and c, and d.

Otherwise week is on schedule for most part.  Skipped the Sunday Kaena ride, first day of relax- no work, no ride, no clean- in long time, was good time to give legs rebuild day and take a rest, this week already busy.  Updated and carried forward, week 25:

  -   - nanakuli mon
    -   - mon eve clean 45 (after 4 day)
    -   - tues work, then clean 43 qt
    -   - weds or thurs clean 601

Mon is news day from Josh on mooring ball, Weds is his planned move day, will know more by then.  
- need to try to get kayak to moondrop Tues?  Good idea:  Off early.  bus home.  Relocate boat.  Straight to 43.  


Good weather article in meantime:

https://seatech.systems/2018/10/21/hf-ssb-weatherfax-reception-using-your-smartphone-or-tablet/

Mon nanakuli, home ss 45 qt maybe
tues 43 qt for sure

Weds update:

Josh says:  Keehi has mooring ball avail!  Next week!  Details still unknown but sounded like it was my choice?!  I think he still inquiring lmsc and wai, however I did let him know mooring fine by me.  At Keehi pref.  
ALSO, says Sat am- go through rigging!!!!  So sounds like panel puller is out?!  Banange yes let's get her to Keehi change money and be done!  Well not done, far from done.  But started!

So this the plan, updated a little:

- fantastic!!!  Big sigh relief, then:
 still standing by lmsc?  Assume keehi mooring:
will need kayak if so.  Maybe Josh help, or get uber or lyft.  
Majors:
    
	- when move?
	- when txfr money?
	- insurance/paperwork when?
minors:
	- ride along for move?  
	- Josh stay how long?
	- dock or intek?
	- 
Plan:  
    - friday half day, get ppk into Keehi.  
	- work around j schedule.
	- love every single minute of life.

Will need:

SO, gonna be busy:  

Good morning!  thoughts:

Weds:  Come on Josh force be with you!

Keehi if Yes:
- fantastic!!!  Big sigh relief, then:
Majors:
	- when move?
	- when txfr money?
	- insurance/paperwork when?
minors:
	- ride along for move?  
	- Josh stay how long?
	- dock or intek?
	- 
Plan:  
    - friday half day, get ppk into Keehi.  
	- work around j schedule.
	- love every single minute of life.


Keehi no or indefinite:    
    - life has obstacles...  Let J know I cannot let md slip away, find plan for md:
    - many balls available keehi, J knows system.  
    - if keehi not work:  Still Waianae or Haleiwa. 
    take some comfort in knowledge of b and c and d...
    - still, Ronell ketch is a remote plan b.
    - plan c is spice. 
    - submit keehi anyway.  Wai, ala wai, etc when able.   
    
 Back to plan A!  Moondrop, in Keehi or whereever:
        - work asmap.
        - cont clean.
        - stay md/prom/wai.  
        - when prom unable, md/wai.  
        - when cch finish:  stay md/wai.
        - when cch finish:  any other or ue.  or wind.

    - slip?  Can keep there?  
    - need 120.  then what?
    - 
    - 
## 7 June  

Summary calls:
Alawai Isaac said can give 120 temp, implied space avail.
Gina Keehi lagoon no space, just filled, but mooring balls move quicker
Jan (yesterday) Keehi Marine no space
Joe Waianae called after lunch, rang no answer
La Mariana not in service.



- keep positive, keehi, wainae lamariana are all plan b's, still hoping for plan A, just stay at ala wai for now, inshallah....

electric boat everything to know:
https://boattest.com/article/tutorial-electrical-propulsion-boats

options maybe:
1) simplest- keep at alawai for now, if possible?
    - get 120 temp, should be easy as part of txfr?
    - get details worked out during that time
    - work on keehi paper, relocate when able
    - a little expensive, naye:
        - secure
        - logistics easy
        - stay 3 nights/week when able, keep working, cleaning, 
        - weekends sort things out
        - huge relief timewise, can relax as sorting.
        
2) temp.  relocate keehi, mooring ball or dock?  
    - need paperwork
    - need kayak or small boat
    - need to relocate 
    - all happen in hurry 
    - need secure. 
    
    Ok, latest iteration of plan:
    
    - Called Ala Wai. Spoke Isaac.  973-9727
    - Is on temp already?  If so, 120 day clock is already running.
    - if NOT on temp- yes, I do paperwork, can get 120 day!!!!!!!!
    
    Next:
    
    - still touch base with keehi for future, and mooring, etc.
    - meet Josh.  
    - 'nuther xfr.'
    - organize ppwk apps for alawai
    - longer out:
        - batt system/charge, security, sails
        - halyards up/down
        - misc
        - sleeps
        - take Merin sailing.  
        
        
7 june rolling on:  Spoke with Gina @ keehi. 832-3464.  Very nice and helpful.  No available, 36ish is limit.  Even mooring is full but in general mooring is easier.  
Gave me Joe number waianae 697-7095
gave tidbit- keep alawai if at all possible.  make sure prior owner no fees. go office together confirm.
(already spoke Jan keehi marine 845-6465, said no avail.)



## Tues 6 June.

- Wow, maybe found it?  1981 Union Polaris 36’ sailboat.  Contacted Josh, meet Fri...  
    - is more than I wanted, less of a project more an investment.  Naaaayeee,  mostly ready to go.  3 sails.  Needs paint.  
    - needs place to stay.  Contact keehi leero.   get on it.  Even if not for this one, get ready.

---
Ok, make links section like so:  

[links to save](#linksection)

sample:
[Custom foo description](#foo)




---

## Mon 15 may - Sun 21 may.  
- new idea for weeks- append prior weeks to bottom of last week?  then becomes tall searchable in one file?  
- iPhoney seems working today???  Otherwise best buy has Oneplus nord 200, (alt nord 20), for a cnote.  
- keep iphoney plugged in tonight and check tomorrrow.  
- when able:  github nav:  check out https://just-the-docs.com/docs/navigation-structure/, has a very clean navigation setup.  
- and, better yet, it incorporates/links to mermaid diagrams (see md kitchen sink on just the docs page).   https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/documentation-portal-publisher-guide/advanced/mermaid?id=examples
- alternatively, https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll-next-version/building-navigation.html using liquid.
- 

### mon: 
get some stuff from down to earth.  bike easy.  get bag to merin for mom.  relax with pavilion and above.  sleep early.  Goal- have enough from above links to make good use of tomorrow.  

- Mon evening:  ok, oahuv1 is up!!! veeery basic template, will ease this navigation issue a hundred times and make a clean presentable site.  
- Tues- work on migrating text and images.  Now that nav will be easy, can focus on content.  Bam, sorted!  Clone to Chromey asap.    
- 
### tues- 
- oahuv1 template in place.  work on later,  
- -for now, try this mermaid stuff!:  
-   --make cheat sheet guide for symbols/syntax
-   -- make smartsheetsflow using guide.  
-   

-- and wtf is wrong with the just the docs project?  was working now some theme issue... fix from home or restart with v2?
-   

Git credential, again:  
 git config credential.helper store
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git

### ok disregard rant earlier, github oahuv1 is running... just needs uploads via vscode, or git, or even ghpages, but do not hit build on gh pages.  Let it run it's own.  So, mostly working simple template site up using new format!!!

Nice bike today after work also.  Toho No, gained about 500, plus total about 10m after work.  Imagine doing fresh sat am, then hike?!?  Can do.

### Thurs  
- shifted week19, week20 to oahuv1.
- pretty smooth day work.
- 601 tonight, should be easy, even though rain.  Eat easy, bkfast easy, sleep easy.
- if 601 done thurs, fri easy day- easy bike work, easy home.  Fix rear brake, prep trip, also misc like laundry.  
- weekend plan:  bike up Manoa Valley to Kolowalu trail.  Park, gear up and hike kolowalu, left turn, Mt. Olympus.  4 mile bike w/500 gain, only about 2ish mile hike tho gain 2000.  Eat bkfast, bring water and some fuel.  Bike down- check out serg kitchen just downhill on right from safeway.  
- rest of weekend for:  hk projects?  R&R, personal mx.  Swim.  shop donquijote.  geek with just-the-docs, jekyll, etc.  
- when able read this:  
- https://routesofchange.org/blog/21-days-alone-at-sea

### Friday!!! 5/19.
