    - 
    - 
## 7 June  

Summary calls:
Alawai Isaac said can give 120 temp, implied space avail.
Gina Keehi lagoon no space, just filled, but mooring balls move quicker
Jan (yesterday) Keehi Marine no space
Joe Waianae called after lunch, rang no answer
La Mariana not in service.



- keep positive, keehi, wainae lamariana are all plan b's, still hoping for plan A, just stay at ala wai for now, inshallah....

electric boat everything to know:
https://boattest.com/article/tutorial-electrical-propulsion-boats

options maybe:
1) simplest- keep at alawai for now, if possible?
    - get 120 temp, should be easy as part of txfr?
    - get details worked out during that time
    - work on keehi paper, relocate when able
    - a little expensive, naye:
        - secure
        - logistics easy
        - stay 3 nights/week when able, keep working, cleaning, 
        - weekends sort things out
        - huge relief timewise, can relax as sorting.
        
2) temp.  relocate keehi, mooring ball or dock?  
    - need paperwork
    - need kayak or small boat
    - need to relocate 
    - all happen in hurry 
    - need secure. 
    
    Ok, latest iteration of plan:
    
    - Called Ala Wai. Spoke Isaac.  973-9727
    - Is on temp already?  If so, 120 day clock is already running.
    - if NOT on temp- yes, I do paperwork, can get 120 day!!!!!!!!
    
    Next:
    
    - still touch base with keehi for future, and mooring, etc.
    - meet Josh.  
    - 'nuther xfr.'
    - organize ppwk apps for alawai
    - longer out:
        - batt system/charge, security, sails
        - halyards up/down
        - misc
        - sleeps
        - take Merin sailing.  
        
        
7 june rolling on:  Spoke with Gina @ keehi. 832-3464.  Very nice and helpful.  No available, 36ish is limit.  Even mooring is full but in general mooring is easier.  
Gave me Joe number waianae 697-7095
gave tidbit- keep alawai if at all possible.  make sure prior owner no fees. go office together confirm.
(already spoke Jan keehi marine 845-6465, said no avail.)



## Tues 6 June.

- Wow, maybe found it?  1981 Union Polaris 36’ sailboat.  Contacted Josh, meet Fri...  
    - is more than I wanted, less of a project more an investment.  Naaaayeee,  mostly ready to go.  3 sails.  Needs paint.  
    - needs place to stay.  Contact keehi leero.   get on it.  Even if not for this one, get ready.

[links to save](#linksection)

sample:
[Custom foo description](#foo)

## Mon 15 may - Sun 21 may.  
- new idea for weeks- append prior weeks to bottom of last week?  then becomes tall searchable in one file?  
- iPhoney seems working today???  Otherwise best buy has Oneplus nord 200, (alt nord 20), for a cnote.  
- keep iphoney plugged in tonight and check tomorrrow.  
- when able:  github nav:  check out https://just-the-docs.com/docs/navigation-structure/, has a very clean navigation setup.  
- and, better yet, it incorporates/links to mermaid diagrams (see md kitchen sink on just the docs page).   https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/documentation-portal-publisher-guide/advanced/mermaid?id=examples
- alternatively, https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll-next-version/building-navigation.html using liquid.
- 

### mon: 
get some stuff from down to earth.  bike easy.  get bag to merin for mom.  relax with pavilion and above.  sleep early.  Goal- have enough from above links to make good use of tomorrow.  

- Mon evening:  ok, oahuv1 is up!!! veeery basic template, will ease this navigation issue a hundred times and make a clean presentable site.  
- Tues- work on migrating text and images.  Now that nav will be easy, can focus on content.  Bam, sorted!  Clone to Chromey asap.    
- 
### tues- 
- oahuv1 template in place.  work on later,  
- -for now, try this mermaid stuff!:  
-   --make cheat sheet guide for symbols/syntax
-   -- make smartsheetsflow using guide.  
-   

-- and wtf is wrong with the just the docs project?  was working now some theme issue... fix from home or restart with v2?
-   

Git credential, again:  
 git config credential.helper store
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git

### ok disregard rant earlier, github oahuv1 is running... just needs uploads via vscode, or git, or even ghpages, but do not hit build on gh pages.  Let it run it's own.  So, mostly working simple template site up using new format!!!

Nice bike today after work also.  Toho No, gained about 500, plus total about 10m after work.  Imagine doing fresh sat am, then hike?!?  Can do.

### Thurs  
- shifted week19, week20 to oahuv1.
- pretty smooth day work.
- 601 tonight, should be easy, even though rain.  Eat easy, bkfast easy, sleep easy.
- if 601 done thurs, fri easy day- easy bike work, easy home.  Fix rear brake, prep trip, also misc like laundry.  
- weekend plan:  bike up Manoa Valley to Kolowalu trail.  Park, gear up and hike kolowalu, left turn, Mt. Olympus.  4 mile bike w/500 gain, only about 2ish mile hike tho gain 2000.  Eat bkfast, bring water and some fuel.  Bike down- check out serg kitchen just downhill on right from safeway.  
- rest of weekend for:  hk projects?  R&R, personal mx.  Swim.  shop donquijote.  geek with just-the-docs, jekyll, etc.
