## Mon 15 may - Sun 21 may.  
- new idea for weeks- append prior weeks to bottom of last week?  then becomes tall searchable in one file?  
- iPhoney seems working today???  Otherwise best buy has Oneplus nord 200, (alt nord 20), for a cnote.  
- keep iphoney plugged in tonight and check tomorrrow.  
- when able:  github nav:  check out https://just-the-docs.com/docs/navigation-structure/, has a very clean navigation setup.  
- and, better yet, it incorporates/links to mermaid diagrams (see md kitchen sink on just the docs page).   https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/documentation-portal-publisher-guide/advanced/mermaid?id=examples
- alternatively, https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll-next-version/building-navigation.html using liquid.
- 

### mon: 
get some stuff from down to earth.  bike easy.  get bag to merin for mom.  relax with pavilion and above.  sleep early.  Goal- have enough from above links to make good use of tomorrow.  

- Mon evening:  ok, oahuv1 is up!!! veeery basic template, will ease this navigation issue a hundred times and make a clean presentable site.  
- Tues- work on migrating text and images.  Now that nav will be easy, can focus on content.  Bam, sorted!  Clone to Chromey asap.    
- 
### tues- 
- oahuv1 template in place.  work on later,  
- -for now, try this mermaid stuff!:  
-   --make cheat sheet guide for symbols/syntax
-   -- make smartsheetsflow using guide.  
-   

-- and wtf is wrong with the just the docs project?  was working now some theme issue... fix from home or restart with v2?
-   

Git credential, again:  
 git config credential.helper store
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git

### ok disregard rant earlier, github oahuv1 is running... just needs uploads via vscode, or git, or even ghpages, but do not hit build on gh pages.  Let it run it's own.  So, mostly working simple template site up using new format!!!

Nice bike today after work also.  Toho No, gained about 500, plus total about 10m after work.  Imagine doing fresh sat am, then hike?!?  Can do.
