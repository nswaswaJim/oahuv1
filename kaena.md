## Kaena


Epic ride around the northwest corner of the island!!!

I had long been curious about this place- an undisturbed coastline?  No access but by foot, boat, or bike?!  The rest of the island is circumfrenced by a road, but not Kaena point.  Let's check it out.  

Logisticlly, it is also cool a way to get from Makaha to Haleiwa in a relatively short distance.  Going around via Kapolei etc seems so far.  

I took the C bus as far as possible, just north side of Makaha.  Then biked to the pavement's end.  I had biked up this far once before but the rest was unknown to me except for what I had seen on Google Maps and read about on Alltrails, Trailforks, etc.  


The route:

Trail on way to point, and the point:
