## Olympus

This trip was a little unique- It was actually somewhat planned, unlike some of my other posts which started out as bike rides/recon missions which evolved into bigger things.  So for Mt. Olympus there was a little prep:

I had a pair of lightweight hiking boots.  Strongly recommended for this trip (and all the others I've recently done).  So thanks to my friends at Eco Town for a great deal on these second hand, perfect for this job North Face hiking boots, I probably would not have made the summmit without them.  

I also brought:  My Mountainsmith bag, which I bought in 1991.  34 years ago.  One tough little bag!  Just a daypack, but we've done many overnights together, also always comes along as carry on.  Shown below at the first grassy patch on the trail:
