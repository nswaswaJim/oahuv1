## Olympus


This trip was a little unique- It was actually somewhat planned, unlike some of my other posts which started out as bike rides/recon missions which evolved into bigger things.  So for Mt. Olympus there was a little prep:

I had a pair of lightweight hiking boots.  Strongly recommended for this trip (and most the others I've recently done).  So thanks to my friends at Eco Town for a great deal on these second hand North Face hiking boots- a great deal all around- the boots didn't end in the landfill but instead end up on top of a mountain, and for me- I actually made it to the top instead of sliding off a muddy drop in my sandals.  

I also brought:  My Mountainsmith bag.  I bought this little bag in 1991, a testament to it's tremendous durability and utility.  Ok, a few pics of the hike:  

The route:

One last push to get to the top:

During breaks in clouds can see the East side towards Kailua/Kaneohe. If zoomed you can pick out some details.
