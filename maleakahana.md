## Maleakahana-

### Beach Camp and falls hike

A packed weekend, fortuitously brought about by our annual conference on Friday on the Windward side in Haleiwa!  And while on that beautiful side of the island, why not explore a bit?  

Maleakahana Beach on the northeast corner has a campground.  I did not have a reservation because I threw this plan together last minute, but long story short- security man at Maleakahana Camp hooked me up with a tiny, secret overflow campsite at 7pm Friday night.   Soon I'm sitting on the beach, under the stars and a waxing half moon, in front of a campfire, eating takeaway Brazilian food from the nearby food trucks in Kahuka.  With the sound of surf on the beach, wind in the trees, and crackling campfire.  

The night was great, as was sunrise:
