## Maleakahana-

### Beach Camping, biking, and hiking!

A packed weekend, fortuitously brought about by our annual conference on Friday on the Windward side in Haleiwa!  And while on that beautiful side of the island, why not explore a bit?  

Maleakahana Beach on the northeast corner has a campground.  I did not have a reservation because I threw this plan together last minute, but long story short- security man at Maleakahana Camp hooked me up with a tiny, secret overflow campsite at 7pm Friday night.   Soon I'm sitting on the beach, under the stars and a waxing half moon, in front of a campfire, eating takeaway Brazilian food from the nearby food trucks in Kahuka.  With the sound of surf on the beach, wind in the trees, and crackling campfire.  

The night was great, as was sunrise:

The next logical step was to visit Maleakahana falls after camping at Maleakahana beach.  

Maleakahana falls trail, along with it's big sister trail Laie falls trail, are both on private property and thus require permits from Hawaii Reserves, Inc.  Permit is available via email, very kind woman in the office processed mine Thursday afternoon.  

Laie falls trailhead is pretty clearly marked both on a map from Hawaii Reserves and on Google Maps.  Maleakahana Falls trailhead- not so much.  From the little bit I had read about, it was just a short distance after the Laie trailhead- can't be too tough to find, right?  

So I enjoyed a pleasant morning ride from Maleakahana beach to the north side of Laie, then up through the small farms in the hills, past the well marked Laie falls trail.  Past the point of network and Google maps, running on my internal memory now... 

After one false start I did find what could have been the trailhead hidden in the turns of country road meandering through the patches of small farms interspersed in the forest.  Let's bike up and find a hillside.  Let's bike up this a bit and maybe get a hilltop with a view and hopefully network.

Bike was heavy and road was deteriorating from country road to muddy steep two track to the point where biking was unfeasable.  Time to park and walk.  Still not exactly sure I was on the right trail.  I reassured myself that I was mostly heading west by southwest, gaining altitude, the major drainage was on my right, the distance seemed to agree with what I had seen on the map.  Still, dead reckoning and most basic pilotage is not the best means of navigation for a hike!  Pressed on anyway.

With altitude and distance the trail changed dramatically, from a jungle forest walk to occaisional exposed sunny stretches.  Which did offer great views of the northern end of the windward side.  For location reference, note the windmills in the distance on the left. Still not exactly sure if I'm on the correct trail.  However going for random lost walk in the remote hills isn't a bad way to spend the morning. </p> 

Soon the trail changed again, into what felt like tunneling though this thick growth.  Less panoramic views but welcome shade, and absolutely no doubt that you are on a trail to somewhere.
