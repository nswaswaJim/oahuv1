## China Walls

Stretching the ride out a bit, pedaled about 10 miles East/Southeast towards Hawaii Kai, with no real destination in mind except maybe a cup of coffee at a marina.    

We made the marina at Hawaii Kai, took a coffee break and a 7-11 snack run.  Then out to China Walls- a tiny spot that looked interesting on Google maps, near the end of the ridge that forms Haunauma bay. 

It is a cool little spot- a secluded, tiny little park in a quiet neighborhood.  Aparently waves can get big here:
