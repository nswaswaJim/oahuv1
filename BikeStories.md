## Bike Stories  

The place for bike specific stuff.  Like today's flat.  Yes, another, just days after Nuuanu trail...

The ride to work today was so unremarkable I won't even finish this sentence  

Then suddenly around lunchtime I noticed, parked behind my desk, in the office, a flat tire.  A tire that just a few hours ago was not only fine, it was...only a few days old?  Well the tube anyway.  The tire itself looks like 1980s, just like the bike.

A well prepared bicyclist always carries a patch kit, a tool kit, a pump, etc blah blah.  That's not me.  All that stuff adds weight.  I carry a BusPass with a few bucks on it.

But instead of taking TheBus, and thus relocating my flat tire problem, I wondered...Fix-a-Flat?  That miracle spare tire in a can?  

A quick look around Google and the concensus was 'don't use this stuff on bikes.'  Luckily I did find one post where someone did use it with great success.  One good story was all I needed.  

One final point- fix-a-flat needs to be driven a few miles immediately after pumping it into the tire.  This helps ensure the sealant is sloshed all around the inside of the tire to seal any small leaks there may be and also to keep the tire in balance.  Well I wasn't sure if I could immediately pedal a few miles in this high density traffic area with a possibly partially flat tire.  Then it struck me...parking garage!  

Up the elevator to the 8th floor.  I changed out of my clean office shirt and into a sweaty riding shirt, got everything situated and was ready to inflate.  First I had to explain this story to security man, who had just showed up wondering what I could be up to, messing about with my bike on the parking garage 8th floor.  He thought my idea might work.  

Sure enough, the fix-a-flat pumped the tire up quickly with only a portion of the can used.  I jumped on and whizzed down the garage and out onto the street, happily pedaling at high speed.  When we finally did need to stop it appeared fix a flat was doing it's job.  If there are no additions to this post, that is good news, it means it not only got me home but also back to work Thursday morning.
