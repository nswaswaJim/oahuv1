## Waikiki Reef Snorkel sampler

### A gopro test.

I found a barely used waterproof gopro12 on Craigslist!  Let's take it for a swim.  

I've only recently started snorkeling again.  It's been great to be back in the water- exercise, stress relief,
appreciation of the ocean.  Adding a gopro to the mix just improves things- of course you want to see more, you don't want
to think you dragged this little camera around for nothing, and thus you end up-seeing more, or staying out longer, or both as was
the case today.  

The video below taken from the reef just off Ft. Derussy beach.  It's taken at low tide, which is not optimal due to waves breaking on the outer edge of the reef
stirring up sediment and reducing visibility.  Low tide is also a challenge because sometimes you are in very shallow water and a wave trough could end you up scraping onto the reef.  (On the plus side, low tide brings things very. very close for filming).  I obviously have a lot to learn about getting underwater vids but wanted to post this first rough attempt.  

3 scenes:  Surprise encounter with a turkey moray.  How many times have I swam right past this?!?  Followed by a pleasant surpise by a tiny sea turtle, a common sighting on the reef.  The last short bit is of what I believe is an oriental gurnard- it's like a flying fish.  Except on reading about it, these ones don't fly- they use their wings to maneuver and glide around the seafloor, and when needed they spread their wings to startle away any predators.  On the front of their 'wings' they have tiny little finger-like appendages which they use to help find food.  I was very, very happy to find the gurnard because I had seen one on my last swim so today with the gopro I wanted to get one on video.  That I found one indicates they are probably common, just well camoflauged.  

Floating over the reef at low tide.  Enjoy!
