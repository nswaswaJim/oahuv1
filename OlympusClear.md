### Second summit on Olympus :-)

Back to Mt. Olympus!  Probably inspired by my recent experience on the  Middle Ridge Trail, which left me wishing for the great trail that Olympus is.  

Not that Olympus is easy!  There is a lot of altitude to gain in a short distance.  There are parts that are perpetual mudpits, sections that steep and muddy and likely impassible in the rain; there are roped sections... but these challenges are just the right amount to make one appreciate Olympus' stretches of steep but mostly enjoyable, mostly shaded trail with some excellent views.  

The plan:  Olympus summit.  Then, along the Koolau Summit Trail over to Paau crater, then down the upper loop of the Paau crater trail.  (I have done the waterfall side of the Paau crater loop but not the upper loop.)  Well that was the plan anyway.

The hike up Olympus went as smoothly as could be wished for.  The trail was mostly dry, and empty- due to light rain in town this morning maybe some people cancelled?  I did not see anyone, not one person, on the Olympus trail until later morning when I was on my way down.  Even then, only saw a handful of people going up. On a Saturday.  Still amazing to see the tremendous views which overlook the densely packed Honolulu just a few miles away, yet up here- complete wilderness and solitude.

Olympus summit was even better than last time!  Great visibility.  Also great to look back north to see where the Middle Ridge Trail joins the Koolau backbone, where I was on Tuesday.  Also very good views of my near-horizon target of K2, and also today's goal of Kaau crater.

Time for Kaau crater trail, via the Koolau Summit Trail.  A very exposed, windswept narrow ridge.  I started my way down, even took a little trail video:

 The windard side of the trail was dry.  Windblown, sunny, exposed, dry.  And narrow and steep.  Still I pressed on to a point where I would be committed, not far below the video:  A point of no return, which I could probably descend, but as equipped, would be potentially hazardous getting back up.   Not only narrow and very steep, it was loose crumbly soil.  Thus it would be point of no return, committed to the rest of the ridgeline- which would likely be more of the same.   I looked over at Kaau crater trail- Not dying today, not dying for you today.  Coming back another day with more gear, meanwhile there is another stretch of trail I'd not done, on the ridge between Manoa and Palolo valleys.  I'll route back that way today.  But not forgetting the ridge trail.

The hike past the Pua Pua trail where I had come up was a great experience, wonderful enough to not regret changing plans from the crater trail.  The ridge was a mostly gentle walk along a good trail carpeted by needles dropped by the whispering pines with some occasional rock scrambles thrown in.  The added benefit- beyond simply exploring an unfamiliar trail- was that I did not know where it was coming out.  I had a general idea but no exact location.  So I just f
