## Tantalus Lookout - Puu Ualakaa State Park

### aka Roundtop ride

The route:  Roundtop road uphill from Makiki.  Intent on something to push my low gear hill climbing limits, this was it!  Climbed 1000' on the bike, then short easy hike on the shady trails at the top.  

The climb was noteworthy in that it shattered my previous bike climb limits.  I had been much more confident in my hiking/climbing ability than bike/climbing, and had been limiting my outings accordingly, in finding trailheads about 500' elevation or so.  But today's batch of banana oatmeal must have been just right because we ground all the way up roundtop road, stopping only once at the scenic overlook vista about 600 feet up for about 15 minutes, then pushed on to the the park/trailhead.

Trusty Christine, strong machine, got me to the top.  Note Diamond Head in the background.  Diamond Head, at 760' in this pic is well below the horizon, a good visual of our altitude gain.

The goal for the day was to ride, so at this point it was mission mostly accomplished.  But why not do a little hike while up at the trailhead?  

So I wandered off up Ualakaa trail.  There is such a network of trails I'm not sure which trail I was on at any given time.  But they are very well marked with signs and maps, impossible to get lost; very good easy trails, kind of place you can take people who don't hike much:
