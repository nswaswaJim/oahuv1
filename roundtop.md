## Tantalus Lookout - Puu Ualakaa State Park

### aka Roundtop ride

The route:  Roundtop road uphill from Makiki.  Intent on something to push my low gear hill climbing limits, this was it!  Climbed 1000' on the bike, then short easy hike on the shady trails at the top.  

The climb was noteworthy in that it shattered my previous bike climb limits.  I had been much more confident in my hiking/climbing ability than bike/climbing, and had been limiting my outings accordingly, in finding trailheads about 500' elevation or so.  But today's batch of banana oatmeal must have been just right because we ground all the way up roundtop road, stopping only once at the scenic overlook vista about 600 feet up for about 15 minutes, then pushed on to the the park/trailhead.

Trusty Christine, strong machine, got me to the top.  Note Diamond Head in the background.  Diamond Head, at 760' in this pic is well below the horizon, a good visual of our altitude gain.

Alone in the tall lush forest full of calming peaceful sounds, hard to believe just a few miles back was urban biking:

The trail starts to change after gaining some elevation- drier, more level, more sunshine:

The forest has changed higher up, with cool breeze now more prominent than the birds lower down the trail:

I wasn't expecting a boardwalk!!!  The Nuuanu trail joins the Pauoa Flats trail, where a few boardwalks keep you above most of the mud.

Christine.  She has been bombproof reliable in her mission of taking us to trailheads.  Good job girl!

...5 minutes after taking the above pic, we were rolling down the road back towards Pali Highway.  Going fast. While thinking in wonder that just a few hours before we were in a slow, steady, laborious uphill low gear hill climbing grind, working for every foot of elevation gain, pedal by pedal.  Now, enjoying that investment in potential energy at high speed...

WHAM!  We hit a small pothole at high speed, a whole-body jarring kind of hit.  Still rolling at high speed I ask "wow, sorry Christine, you ok?!?" That we were still in control indicated maybe she was. The hissing sound from the front tire indicated perhaps she was not.  

Things to be grateful for:  Lucky Pali Highway was very near.  Thanks to the cool people at TheBus, who gave Christine and I a ride down to town and to my now favorite bike shop Velohana on Nuuanu.  Where I met two awesome people, owner Will and Triathlete Ku, who stopped what they were doing and hooked me up with a new tube install and got me back on my way in no time.  Thank you Velohana!!!
