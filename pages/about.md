<p>Oh You clicked the image instead of the navigation links! Ok now you have a tangent.</p>

<p>Ok, this image is NOT from biking around the island.  It was an image I put on the page as a placeholder while making the site, and is just too good to take down.</p>

<p>This is the evening sun setting in one of the most amazing, magical places that I know of on the entire planet.  Volcanos, high altitude lakes dotted with beautiful islands; three borders and all the culture, trade, markets that brings, all blending together at the bottom of the slopes of these incredible volcanos.</p>

<h3>** Ok, now the About: **</h3>
<p>It is amazing how something so simple like a bike can change things.  Actually two bikes…
My first bike was a classic cruiser, a $110 rusty but very stylish, comfortable, 30 year old cruiser.  Quite perfect for my desired task, which was mostly just getting to work.  However, on my first day of work, someone needed that bike more than I and cut the lock.  Well things happen for a reason.  I called the man I bought that bike from and got the even older, even rustier, even more economical bike which I have now.  The XL frame Raleigh, 1980’s vintage.  Too big for me, this bike is made for someone like 6’2, however it was ready to go.  And thus far has been incredibly reliable and taken me to many new places in a very short time.  So that’s what started this site, a place to post where the bike has led me.  More to come!</p>
