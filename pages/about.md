**Ok, now the About:**  

It is amazing how something so simple like a bike can change things.  It started with just wanting a more interesting way to get to work than TheBus. Why not TheBike?  Then things got more interesting, in wondering where else the bike could take me besides to the office.  So thatâ€™s what started this site, a place to post where the bike has led me.  More to come!


**Why videos?**  

Put the viewer in the scene a little better.  A pic is worth a thousand words, a video is a thousand pics in rapid succession, do the math.  Also builds the foundation of a site for my future 4D virtual reality site.  For now just enjoy the phone vids.

**Why is my bike called Christine?** 

Old Stephen King story about a kid who buys an old rustbucket beater car to rebuild.  Turns out the car is posessed in a bad way and has a mind of it's own.  Ends badly of course but the kid had a good time up to that point.  


**Why Github?**  

Well, it's free, I like that.  It's a place for collaboration, I like that too.  And a chance to learn a bit about the git process, which is a cool thing in a geeky way:

**Why NswaswaJim?**  

My old nickname.  Nile Monitor lizard.  Amazing creatures, happiest at the water's edge:

**PS Ok, the opening image** on the index page is NOT from biking around the island.  It was an image I put up as placeholder while making a page template for the site, and is just too good to take down:</p>
