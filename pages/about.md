**Ok, now the About:**  

It is amazing how something so simple like a used bike can change things.  It started with just wanting a more interesting way to get to work than TheBus. Why not TheBike?  Then things got real when TheBike started taking me more places than just The Office.  So thatâ€™s what started this site, a place to post places the bike is taking me.  More to come!


**Why videos?**  

Put the viewer in the scene a little better.  A pic is worth a thousand words, a video is a thousand pics in rapid succession, do the math.  So no, not exactly red-bull kinda stuff but better than a pic.  The sound of waves and forest is also a bonus. Finally, this builds the foundation of a site for my future 4D virtual reality site.  For now just enjoy the 2D pics and vids.

**Tech stuff:**

Some nice features in case you weren't aware:
Videos can be made full-screen, click the box in the player controls at bottom of video.
Most route maps are embedded from Google Maps thus have zoom and full-screen features enabled. 
Panoramic images can be clicked to open a much larger zoomable image which can be scrolled around.  

Best viewed in Chrome, tested and appears working in Firefox, Edge, and Opera.  Mobiles- large items like videos, maps, and panoramics display better in landscape mode, but much better on larger display.

What is github?  Free, I like that.  It's a place for collaboration, I like that too.  And a chance to learn a bit about the git process, which is a cool thing in a geeky way:

**Why NswaswaJim in the site address?**

Github required a name.  Nswaswa is my old nickname.  Nile Monitor lizard.  Amazing creatures, happiest at the water's edge:

**PS Ok, the opening image** on the index page is NOT from biking around this island.  It was an image I put up as placeholder when building a page template for the site, and is just too good to take down:</p>
