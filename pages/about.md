**Ok, now the About:**  

It is amazing how something so simple like a used bike can change things.  It started with just wanting a more interesting way to get to work than TheBus. Why not TheBike?  Soon the bike started taking me places beyond just The Office.  Thus this github page to easily share some sample pics and vids from exploring Oahu.

Videos:  the intent is to put the viewer in the scene a little better.  A pic is worth a thousand words, a video is just a thousand pics put together, so do the math.  So while it's nothing like red-bull exciting kinda stuff, the trail videos have some added value over just pics.  The sound of blissful audio of waves and forest is a bonus with video.    

**Tech stuff:**

Some nice features in case you weren't aware:  
The videos can be made full-screen, just click the box in the player controls at bottom of the video.  
Most route maps are embedded from Google Maps thus have zoom and full-screen features enabled.   
Panoramic images can be clicked to open a much larger zoomable image in a new tab which can be scrolled around.
