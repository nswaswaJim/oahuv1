## Kaala, highest peak on Oahu.  First climb.


What started out as just a ride...ended up in a hike to the top of the highest peak on Oahu!  

It was supposed to be just a ride to the trailhead, then a little recon hike.  Wearing sandals and carrying a tiny snack and not enough water.  But eventually ended up on top!  In the cloud, rain, very low vis.  Ok well the recon run actually made it to the top, and left a desire to come back.
